## Letâ€™s say we are trying to save some money and we are watching our budget. We need to make sure that the result of our spending is less than the total amount we have allocated for each of the categories. Our function will accept a parameter called budget which describes our spending limit. The next four parameters describe what we are spending our money on. We need to sum all of our spendings and compare it to the budget. If we have gone over budget, we will return True. Otherwise we return False.
# Write your over_budget function here:
def over_budget(budget, food_bill, electricity_bill, internet_bill, rent):
  eq = food_bill + electricity_bill + internet_bill + rent
  if eq > budget:
    return True
  else:
    return False
# Uncomment these function calls to test your over_budget function:
print(over_budget(100, 20, 30, 10, 40))
# should print False
print(over_budget(80, 20, 30, 10, 30))
# should print True
