## For the first code challenge, we are going to create a method that tests whether the result of taking the power of one number to another number provides an answer which is greater than 5000. We will use a conditional statement to return True if the result is greater than 5000 or return False if it is not.
# Write your large_power function here:
def large_power(base, exponent):
  eq = base ** exponent
  if eq > 5000:
    return True
  else:
    return False
# Uncomment these function calls to test your large_power function:
print(large_power(2, 13))
# should print True
print(large_power(2, 12))
# should print False
