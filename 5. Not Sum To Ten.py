## Finally, we are going to check if the summation of two inputs does not equal ten. Our function will accept two inputs and add them together. If the two numbers added together are not equal to ten, then we will return True, otherwise, we will return False.
# Write your not_sum_to_ten function here:
def not_sum_to_ten(num1, num2):
  if num1 + num2 != 10:
    return True
  else:
    return False
# Uncomment these function calls to test your not_sum_to_ten function:
print(not_sum_to_ten(9, -1))
# should print True
print(not_sum_to_ten(9, 1))
# should print False
print(not_sum_to_ten(5,5))
# should print False
