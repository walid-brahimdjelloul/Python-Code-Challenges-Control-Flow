## To make things a bit more challenging, we are going to create a function that determines whether or not a number is divisible by ten. A number is divisible by ten if the remainder of the number divided by 10 is 0.
# Write your divisible_by_ten() function here:
def divisible_by_ten(num):
  if num % 10 == 0:
    return True
  else:
    return False


# Uncomment these print() function calls to test your divisible_by_ten() function:

print(divisible_by_ten(20))
# should print True
print(divisible_by_ten(25))
# should print False
